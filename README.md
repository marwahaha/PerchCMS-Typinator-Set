#Setting it up
Once you have Typinator installed, you can use its new subscribe function to connect to this set of Perch expansions.
Under the Action menu, select Sets, and then select Subscribe to Set via URL...
In the window that pops up, enter this address:
  https://github.com/montlewis/PerchCMS-Typinator-Set/raw/master/PerchCMS.typubset
So now the Perch expansion set should be in the sets panel of the Typinator application and you should be able to start using them!
You can set which applications your expansion sets are active in. This is done with the little application icon under the list of sets.
Also, there is one expansion pHelp\, that's pretty handy and calls up Typinator's quick search window for searching through the expansions. (the help one that searches though the expansions) that is set to {key:⌥⇧⌘"."} use a key command of shift-option-command-.(period). So you should go to Typinator's preferences and set the quick search to that set of keys.
